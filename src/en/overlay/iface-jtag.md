# JTAG - Joint Test Action Group

JTAG is a standardized interface for debugging integrated circuits which you can use to debug your BeagleY-AI.

**(*) - JTAG is not available on the 40 Pin Header on BeagleY-AI.  The interface is instead available via the TagConnect 10 pin connector under the USB Type-A ports.**

Due to space constraints, the original retaining clips will not fit, but a 3D printable version is [available on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/879533-beagley-ai-tagconnect-clip-10pin).
