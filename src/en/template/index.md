# Pinout!

### The BeagleY-AI GPIO pinout guide.

This GPIO Pinout is an interactive reference to the BeagleY-AI GPIO pins, and a guide to the BeagleY-AI's GPIO interfaces. Pinout also includes [hundreds of pinouts for BeagleY-AI add-on boards, HATs and pHATs](/boards).

## What do these numbers mean?

* GPIO - General Purpose Input/Output, aka "BCM" or "Broadcom". These are the big numbers, e.g. "GPIO 22". You'll use these with RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero.
* Physical - or "Board" correspond to the pin's physical location on the header. These are the small numbers next to the header, e.g. "Physical Pin 15".
* SoC - or "Schematic" pins that match the actual processor. These are shown as a tooltip when you mouse over a pin. 
* socpin - for Gordon Henderson's Wiring Pi library.

## What's the orientation of this pinout?

Pinout depicts pin 1 in the top left corner. Pin 1 is the only pin with a square solder pad, which may only be visible from the underside of your Pi. If you orient your Pi such that you are looking at the top with the GPIO on the right and HDMI port(s) on the left, your orientation will match Pinout.
